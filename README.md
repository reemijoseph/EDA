# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.
EDA techniques include statistical summaries, data visualization, and sometimes more advanced methods such as clustering or dimensionality reduction.
The aim of EDA is to gain insights into the data that can guide further analysis or decision-making processes.
Here I have done an EDA of a employee dataset in ABC company entails analyzing distributions, correlations, and anomalies to glean insights into workforce performance, and trends.
There are some steps provided below to perform EDA:


Step1:Import libraries-Import all python libraries required for our data analysis, such as data loading, statistical summaries, visualizations, transformation etc


Step2:Reading of dataset-Identifying the data source and loading it into a suitable programming environment.Here we are using the read_csv() function to convert data into pandas dataframe.
Most of the data are available in a tabular format in CSV files.


Step3:Data Preparation- Perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values,number of rows and columns, converting data types, or renaming columns to ensure the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis.


Step4:Data Exploration and visualization: Begin exploring the dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, relationships, and patterns using techniques such as summary statistics, data visualization, and exploratory analyses.


Step5:Data Story:This refers to the narrative or insights derived from analyzing a dataset.


These steps provide a structured approach to explore and gain insights from a dataset during the EDA process.
